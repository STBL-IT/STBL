# AccessControlUpgradeable







*Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn&#39;t allow enumerating role members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see {AccessControlEnumerable}. Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by using `public constant` hash digests: ```solidity bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(&quot;MY_ROLE&quot;); ``` Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a function call, use {hasRole}: ```solidity function foo() public {     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));     ... } ``` Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only accounts that have a role&#39;s admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}. By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using {_setRoleAdmin}. WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure accounts that have been granted it. We recommend using {AccessControlDefaultAdminRules} to enforce additional security measures for this role.*

## Methods

### DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE

```solidity
function DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE() external view returns (bytes32)
```






#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bytes32 | undefined |

### getRoleAdmin

```solidity
function getRoleAdmin(bytes32 role) external view returns (bytes32)
```



*Returns the admin role that controls `role`. See {grantRole} and {revokeRole}. To change a role&#39;s admin, use {_setRoleAdmin}.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| role | bytes32 | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bytes32 | undefined |

### grantRole

```solidity
function grantRole(bytes32 role, address account) external nonpayable
```



*Grants `role` to `account`. If `account` had not been already granted `role`, emits a {RoleGranted} event. Requirements: - the caller must have ``role``&#39;s admin role. May emit a {RoleGranted} event.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| role | bytes32 | undefined |
| account | address | undefined |

### hasRole

```solidity
function hasRole(bytes32 role, address account) external view returns (bool)
```



*Returns `true` if `account` has been granted `role`.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| role | bytes32 | undefined |
| account | address | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bool | undefined |

### renounceRole

```solidity
function renounceRole(bytes32 role, address callerConfirmation) external nonpayable
```



*Revokes `role` from the calling account. Roles are often managed via {grantRole} and {revokeRole}: this function&#39;s purpose is to provide a mechanism for accounts to lose their privileges if they are compromised (such as when a trusted device is misplaced). If the calling account had been revoked `role`, emits a {RoleRevoked} event. Requirements: - the caller must be `callerConfirmation`. May emit a {RoleRevoked} event.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| role | bytes32 | undefined |
| callerConfirmation | address | undefined |

### revokeRole

```solidity
function revokeRole(bytes32 role, address account) external nonpayable
```



*Revokes `role` from `account`. If `account` had been granted `role`, emits a {RoleRevoked} event. Requirements: - the caller must have ``role``&#39;s admin role. May emit a {RoleRevoked} event.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| role | bytes32 | undefined |
| account | address | undefined |

### supportsInterface

```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) external view returns (bool)
```



*See {IERC165-supportsInterface}.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| interfaceId | bytes4 | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bool | undefined |



## Events

### Initialized

```solidity
event Initialized(uint64 version)
```



*Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| version  | uint64 | undefined |

### RoleAdminChanged

```solidity
event RoleAdminChanged(bytes32 indexed role, bytes32 indexed previousAdminRole, bytes32 indexed newAdminRole)
```



*Emitted when `newAdminRole` is set as ``role``&#39;s admin role, replacing `previousAdminRole` `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is the starting admin for all roles, despite {RoleAdminChanged} not being emitted signaling this.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| role `indexed` | bytes32 | undefined |
| previousAdminRole `indexed` | bytes32 | undefined |
| newAdminRole `indexed` | bytes32 | undefined |

### RoleGranted

```solidity
event RoleGranted(bytes32 indexed role, address indexed account, address indexed sender)
```



*Emitted when `account` is granted `role`. `sender` is the account that originated the contract call. This account bears the admin role (for the granted role). Expected in cases where the role was granted using the internal {AccessControl-_grantRole}.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| role `indexed` | bytes32 | undefined |
| account `indexed` | address | undefined |
| sender `indexed` | address | undefined |

### RoleRevoked

```solidity
event RoleRevoked(bytes32 indexed role, address indexed account, address indexed sender)
```



*Emitted when `account` is revoked `role`. `sender` is the account that originated the contract call:   - if using `revokeRole`, it is the admin role bearer   - if using `renounceRole`, it is the role bearer (i.e. `account`)*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| role `indexed` | bytes32 | undefined |
| account `indexed` | address | undefined |
| sender `indexed` | address | undefined |



## Errors

### AccessControlBadConfirmation

```solidity
error AccessControlBadConfirmation()
```



*The caller of a function is not the expected one. NOTE: Don&#39;t confuse with {AccessControlUnauthorizedAccount}.*


### AccessControlUnauthorizedAccount

```solidity
error AccessControlUnauthorizedAccount(address account, bytes32 neededRole)
```



*The `account` is missing a role.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| account | address | undefined |
| neededRole | bytes32 | undefined |

### InvalidInitialization

```solidity
error InvalidInitialization()
```



*The contract is already initialized.*


### NotInitializing

```solidity
error NotInitializing()
```



*The contract is not initializing.*
